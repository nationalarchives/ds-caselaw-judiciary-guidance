            Standard rubric wording within Family Proceedings
          </h3>
          <p>
            Within family proceedings, the content of the rubric can be varied
            but tends to contain the following standard wording:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave
            for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that
            (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published
            version of the judgment the anonymity of the incapacitated person/
            [child] and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All
            persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that
            this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a
            contempt of court
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The TNA publishing team will read the terms of the rubric and check
            that the judgment complies with any restrictions. For example, the
            rubric may contain the standard wording or be varied to cover
            specific requirements such as the redaction of expert witness
            details or addresses. The publishing team will contact the clerk if
            they are in any doubt about content that may be contrary to the
            rubric or that may lead to the identification of parties anonymised
            by the rubric.

            We understand that this is the standard wording used before
            publication, where the draft judgment is shared with the legal
            representatives directly involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this is present, the publishing team will check with the clerk
            that it is acceptable to publish in its current form, and the clerk
            may choose to publish as-is or upload an amended version. We would
            ask that clerks remove this warning if no longer relevant, as
            publication will be delayed while we contact the relevant clerk to
            confirm that the judgment can be published.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-4" id="shorter">Shorter Rubric Statements</h3>
          <p>Some judgments contain a shorter rubric statement:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave
            for this version of the judgment to be published. In this instance,
            the team will confirm that the party names have been referenced
            within the judgment in a way that is consistent with the front
            sheet. The team will check that any parties that are anonymised on
            the front sheet are consistently anonymised throughout the judgment.

            This prohibition applies unless it is waived or lifted in accordance
            with s.3 of the Act. In the light of the relationship between the

            The TNA publishing team will do their best to check that any
            anonymity restrictions applied to these judgments have been done so
            consistently throughout the judgment. Additionally, the team will
            contact the clerk if they identify any possible inconsistencies to
            confirm with the clerk whether the judgment can be published in its
            current form.

            General Warnings &ndash; (Warnings contained within transcribed
            judgments)
          </h3>

          <p>
            Judgments may contain a general warning which may or may not be
            relevant to that specific judgment &ndash; see example wording
            below. This general warning tends to be found more frequently within
            transcribed judgments. If possible, please remove this general
            warning if it is not applicable to the specific judgment. Where this
            warning is present, the publishing team will complete closer checks
            to ensure that the warning is complied with, and this will create
            delays in publication to the Find Case Law site.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            WARNING: reporting restrictions may apply to the contents

            Where a judgment has been redacted in some way, whether that is
            party names, addresses or witnesses, the publishing team will check
            to ensure that any redactions have been applied consistently within
            the judgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not checking overarching anonymity requirements, the team does
            have an awareness of general issues, including: the need to provide
            anonymity for victims or potential victims of sexual offences;
            trafficking; female genital mutilation; anonymity of children
            subject to family proceedings; children subject to proceedings
            within the youth court, and criminal retrials. Occasionally, the
            publishing team may contact the clerk if they have any queries
            relating to these matters to seek confirmation that the judgment is
            for publication in its current form as a matter of caution.
