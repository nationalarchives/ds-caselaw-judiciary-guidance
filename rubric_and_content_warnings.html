          Standard rubric wording within Family Proceedings
        </h3>
        <p>
          Within family proceedings, the content of the rubric can be varied
          but tends to contain the following standard wording:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave
          for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that
          (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published
          version of the judgment the anonymity of the incapacitated person/
          [child] and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All
          persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that
          this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a
          contempt of court
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The editorial team will read the terms of the rubric and check
          that the judgment complies with any restrictions. For example, the
          rubric may contain the standard wording or be varied to cover
          specific requirements such as the redaction of expert witness
          details or addresses. The editorial team will contact the uploader if
          they are in any doubt about content that may be contrary to the
          rubric or that may lead to the identification of parties anonymised
          by the rubric.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Examples of standard rubric wording with specific
            variations:</strong>
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave
          for this version of the judgment to be published. In no report of
          these proceedings or this judgment may the addresses of the persons
          referred to as Amy, Denise, Bridget and Pieter be given. All persons
          including representatives of the media must strictly comply with
          this condition breach of which will be a contempt of court. There
          are no other reporting restrictions. &ndash;

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave
          for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that
          in any report of, or commentary on, the judgment the children shall
          not be named or photographs of them displayed. This prohibition
          applies notwithstanding that their father and their late mother are
          named in the judgment. It mirrors the convention used at the
          sentencing hearing referred to in the judgment. All persons,
          including representatives of the media, must ensure that this
          condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a
          contempt of court pursuant to sec 12 Administration of Justice Act

        <h3 class="mt-4" id="non-standard">Non-Standard Rubric Wording</h3>
        <p>
          Occasionally judgments and decisions are received containing the following
          wording:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          This decision was delivered in private to the parties and their
          lawyers. They may not show or otherwise communicate this decision or
          its contents to any other person. Any party or their lawyers wishing
          to show or inform any other person about the decision or any other
          person wishing to see the decision must first come back to court and
          obtain the permission of [their] Honour XXX
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We understand that this is the standard wording used before
          publication, where the draft judgment is shared with the legal
          representatives directly involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this is present, the editorial team will check with the uploader
          that it is acceptable to publish in its current form, and the uploader
          may choose to publish as-is or upload an amended version. We would
          ask that uploader remove this warning if no longer relevant, as
          publication will be delayed while we contact the relevant uploader to
          confirm that the judgment or decision can be published.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4" id="shorter">Shorter Rubric Statements</h3>
        <p>Some judgments and decisions contain a shorter rubric statement:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave
          for this version of the judgment to be published. In this instance,
          the team will confirm that the party names have been referenced
          within the judgment in a way that is consistent with the front
          sheet. The team will check that any parties that are anonymised on
          the front sheet are consistently anonymised throughout the judgment.

        <h4 class="mt-4" id="specific">Specific warnings</h4>
        <p>

          The editorial team will do their best to check that any anonymity restrictions applied
          to these documents have been done so consistently throughout the judgment or
          decision. Additionally, the team will contact the uploader if they identify any possible
          inconsistencies to confirm with the uploader whether the document can be published
          in its current form.

          General Warnings &ndash; (Warnings contained within transcribed
          judgments/decisions)
        </h3>

        <p>
          Judgments and decisions may contain a general warning which may or may not be
          relevant to that specific judgment/decision &ndash; see example wording below. This
          general warning tends to be found more frequently within transcribed
          judgments/decisions. If possible, please remove this general warning if it is not
          applicable to the specific judgment/decision. Where this warning is present, the
          editorial team will complete closer checks to ensure that the warning is complied
          with, and this will create delays in publication to the Find Case Law site.
        </p>

          WARNING: reporting restrictions may apply to the contents
          transcribed in this document, particularly if the case concerned a
          sexual offence or involved a child. Reporting restrictions prohibit
          the publication of the applicable information to the public or any
          section of the public, in writing, in a broadcast or by means of the
          internet, including social media. Anyone who receives a copy of this
          transcript is responsible in law for making sure that applicable
          restrictions are not breached. A person who breaches a reporting
          restriction is liable to a fine and/or imprisonment. For guidance on
          whether reporting restrictions apply, and to what information, ask
          at the court office or take legal advice.

          Where a judgment/decision has been redacted in some way, whether that is party
          names, addresses or witnesses, the editorial team will check to ensure that any
          redactions have been applied consistently within the judgment/decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          While not checking overarching anonymity requirements, the team does have an
          awareness of general issues, including: the need to provide anonymity for victims or
          potential victims of sexual offences; trafficking; female genital mutilation; anonymity
          of children subject to family proceedings; children subject to proceedings within the
          youth court, and criminal retrials. Occasionally, the editorial team may contact the
          uploader if they have any queries relating to these matters to seek confirmation that
          the judgment or decision is for publication in its current form as a matter of caution.
